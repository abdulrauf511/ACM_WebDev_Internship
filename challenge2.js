/* 
1. The first mistake is in the variable declaration. In the provided code, there is a space between `some` and `Number`, which makes it an invalid variable name. It should be */
const someNumber = 20;

/* 
2. The second mistake is trying to reassign a value to a constant variable. In JavaScript, when you declare a variable using `const`, its value cannot be changed once it's initialized. In the provided code, `someNumber` is declared using `const`, but then an attempt is made to reassign it with `someNumber = 50;`, which is not allowed. To fix this, you should use `let` instead of `const` if you intend to reassign the variable, like this: */
let someNumber = 20;

/*
3. **Case sensitivity**: JavaScript is case-sensitive, so `someNumber` and `some Number` are considered as two different variables. In the code, `someNumber` is declared and used later, but the attempt to reassign the variable is made using `some Number`, which is incorrect. The correct variable name should be consistent throughout the code, and in this case, it should be `someNumber`*/
let someNumber = 20;
someNumber = 50;
